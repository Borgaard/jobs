# jobs

The process to post a new job is:

1. Add your file to https://github.com/npm/jobs with a <year> <quarter> <title> name (because an archive of previous jobs copy is nice and this is more convenient than digging through commit history).

2. Edit https://github.com/npm/static-pages/blob/master/jobs.md to include your file.

3. Make sure the links in the top of the file are accurate, and reflect current hiring priorities (e.g. "we are looking for <x postion>" if there's only one job listed)
