# team lead, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All these plans require we grow the www team from its current size of two to five people in 2015, and we want the first of those hires to be a senior engineer, capable of taking responsibility for the architecture of the site and leading the team.

That means an engineer with experience working on big projects, able to make tricky architectural decisions and then successfully communicate and delegate the implementation. We want somebody who also has the inclination to handle the task juggling and messy human parts of keeping a group of smart, motivated individuals happy and productive. 

We know that's not every engineer's idea of a good time. If this isn't what you want, we're hiring two other engineers. But if you're worried that you're not experienced enough, we encourage you to apply -- let us make that call. The worst that can happen is that we'll hire you for one of the other positions.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

Because of the amount of face time involved in representing the team, we are not accepting remote applicants for this role. This will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA.
