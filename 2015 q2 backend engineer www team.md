# backend engineer, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All of this stuff relies on smart, well-designed APIs that integrate easily with our front-end code. As a backend engineer on the www team, you'll serve as the bridge between the registry and www teams, working in both code bases. You'll extend existing APIs to tackle new needs, add endpoints to increase efficiency, and spin up whole new services to provide the features that the site is going to need.

We're not looking for a shopping list of languages and technologies. We're looking for people who are smart and get stuff done, who have a track record of understanding complicated problems and solving them. For this role in particular, it'll be important that you are a strong communicator and big-picture thinker, capable of weaving teams and systems together to achieve your goals. You probably won't be writing HTML and CSS, but it's a good idea if you care about websites.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

We have a strong preference for candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, CA, but we are accepting exceptional remote candidates who have a proven track record of successful remote work.
