npm has more than 3 million users worldwide and that number is growing fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers. And every day, tens of thousands of brand-new users show up.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with better than 99.999% uptime, and we do it by answering, one by one, each of the dozens of tweets, emails and GitHub issues that our users send us every day. npm has been successful because we care about our users, and we intend to keep taking care of them.

To that end, we're building out a dedicated support team, of which you'll be the founding member. Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of every member of the engineering team (who are the ones currently doing all these things).

The right person for this job is somebody technical but inexperienced who is looking to grow into an engineering role at npm. By solving every type of problem and interacting with every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that makes great support engineers so valuable.

You'll report directly to Isaac, CEO and inventor of npm, and a former front-line support engineer himself. You'll be a full member of the team with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options. We are not accepting remote candidates for this role.
